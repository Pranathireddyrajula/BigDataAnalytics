## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
The project Airline Delays Analysis focuses on examining patterns, causes, and impacts of flight delays using multi-year aggregated airline performance data. The dataset includes information about carriers, airports, years, and months, along with the number of arriving flights, delayed flights, cancellations, diversions, and the distribution of delay causes such as carrier issues, weather, National Airspace System (NAS), security, and late aircraft. The data was cleaned and preprocessed by converting categorical and numeric fields to suitable types and engineering additional features like delay probability, cancellation rate, and on-time performance rate. These metrics provided valuable benchmarks to compare airline and airport efficiency.

The analysis identified the top 10 busiest airports based on flight volumes and highlighted how congestion contributes to delays. Breakdown of delay causes revealed that carrier-related issues and late aircraft accounted for the majority of delays, while weather-related disruptions were seasonal and geographically concentrated. Security delays were found to be minimal. By comparing airlines, the study showed variations in average delays, cancellation rates, and overall reliability, with some carriers consistently outperforming others. Monthly and seasonal analysis indicated spikes in delays during peak travel periods, aligning with holidays and adverse weather seasons.

Key insights suggest that operational inefficiencies, rather than external factors, are the primary drivers of delays. Recommendations include improving ground handling processes, scheduling efficiency, and preparedness for seasonal weather challenges. Airports with heavy traffic should focus on congestion management, while airlines with high cancellation rates require stricter monitoring and compliance. Overall, the project demonstrates how data-driven insights can improve reliability, reduce delays, and enhance passenger experience in the aviation sector.
